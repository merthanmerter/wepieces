# WEPIECES

## Getting Started

### About

WEPIECES is a highly inspired application starter kit based on
[create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/). It‚Äôs 100% production ready and built
with technologies like Bun, Hono, Tr√¶fik, Redis, Docker, React, tRPC, Drizzle,
Jotai, Zod, Tailwind, Jose, and more. The goal of this project is to provide a
modern web application framework that doesn't require features like server-side
rendering (SSR) or search engine optimization (SEO). It‚Äôs an ideal choice for
fast and simple deployment using Docker or even Bun executables, requiring
little to no configuration.

### Features

- üî• Full-stack development with Hono, tRPC and React.
- üì¶ Modular architecture with a separation of concerns
- üîê Authentication with Jose
- üêò PostgreSQL database with Drizzle
- üêã 100% Production Ready with Docker
- üö¢ Ready to deploy to any VPS or Cloud provider

### Technologies

- Bun
- Hono
- tRPC
- Tr√¶fik
- Redis
- Docker
- React
- Vite
- Tanstack
- Jotai
- Drizzle
- PostgreSQL
- Zod
- Jose
- Tailwind
- ShadcnUI

### Roadmap

- CLI integration for better project scaffolding and DX.
- Improve authentication and authorization. Add ~~database sessions~~ and
  permissions.
- Integrate image uploads and storage management. Image optimization and
  compression with sharp.

### Prerequisites

- Bun 1.x or higher
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wepieces/wepieces.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd wepieces
bun install
```

3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
bun run docker:dev
bun run dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Build the application for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

2. Migrate the database:

Since the database ports should not be exposed in docker-compose, this will
require some manual steps. Currently, you need to expose the ports and remove
them after the migration in the docker-compose configuration.

```
bun run migrate
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost`.

## How to deploy to Render

1. Create a new project on Render.com
2. Create a postgres database
3. Create a new web service
4. Import environment variables from `.env.example` file
5. Update `DATABASE` environment variable with your render database credentials
6. Update `SUPERADMIN` environment variables with your render credentials
7. Update `SECRET` environment variable with a random string (e.g.
   `openssl rand -hex 32`)
8. Update `NODE_ENV` environment variable with `production`
9. Deploy the project from your git repository
10. Similar steps can be followed to deploy to other platforms.

## How to deploy to VPS or Cloud

1. Create an instance on your provider.
2. Install bun and docker.
3. Clone the repository.
4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.
5. Build the docker image.
6. Make sure to apply all security best practices to your server.
