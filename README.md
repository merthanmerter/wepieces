# WEPIECES

## Getting Started

### About

WEPIECES is a highly inspired application starter kit based on
[create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/). It’s 100% production ready and built
with technologies like Bun, Hono, Træfik, Redis, Docker, React, tRPC, Drizzle,
Jotai, Zod, Tailwind, Jose, and more. The goal of this project is to provide a
modern web application framework that doesn't require features like server-side
rendering (SSR) or search engine optimization (SEO). It’s an ideal choice for
fast and simple deployment using Docker or even Bun executables, requiring
little to no configuration.

### Features

- 🔥 Full-stack development with Hono, tRPC and React.
- 📦 Modular architecture with a separation of concerns
- 🔐 Authentication with Jose
- 🐘 PostgreSQL database with Drizzle
- 🐋 100% Production Ready with Docker
- 🚢 Ready to deploy to any VPS or Cloud provider
